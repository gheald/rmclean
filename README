RMCLEAN v1.8

This directory contains the miriad task rmclean, which cleans rm spectra
contained in (RA,DEC,RM) cubes. The input cubes must be reordered such
that the RM axis is first. This can be done by hand before running the
task itself, or automatically using the included runrmclean.py script.
For help with runrmclean.py, type 'runrmclean.py -h'

The input parameters are described in rmclean.doc, which can be placed in
$MIRDOC for use within miriad's help system.

The code (rmclean.for) compiles both under darwin_x86 and linux64. It
probably works on other systems but I haven't tested that.

To get the task to work, these steps were sufficient for me:
1.  Run miriad task 'mirtree' in $HOME to generate a source tree
2a. Place rmclean.for in $HOME/miriad/prog
2b. Place rmclean.h in $HOME/miriad/inc
3a. Determine your fortran compiler (e.g. f77)
3b. Type 'make FC=your_fortran_compiler' in $HOME/miriad/prog
4.  The executable is now in $HOME/miriad/<arch>/bin
    This directory can be added to your $PATH
